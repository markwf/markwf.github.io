			<h2>Born in Germany to British Parents</h2>
			<p>
				My parents moved out to Germany before I was born (my dad was offered
				a job there). They didn't know how to speak German, but they picked it
				up quickly after enrolling on a 3-month intensive course and they
				settled down and decided to start a family. I got to spend the first
				couple years of my life in Bavaria, which I sadly don't remember.

				When I launched OUSBMS I needed to make the society a website.

				learn how to code and build my own one. I started going to coding
				meetups run by Oxford Code Lab, Oxford CompSoc and Oxford
