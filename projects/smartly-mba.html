                <p>
                  Smartly’s MBA also ties the education directly into career development. Upon enrolling into the program, students join Smartly Talent, which is an alumni and employer network that helps Smartly students connect with each other and discover new job opportunities.

                <h3>What do MBA students learn?</h3>
                <p>
                  Aligned with the world's leading business schools, the MBA degree comprises courses across business disciplines. Smartly's program consists of nine subject areas, including Business Foundations, Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Economics, Business Strategy, Data and Analysis, Leadership and Management, Supply Chain and Operations.
                </p>
                <h3>Who developed the courses?</h3>
                <p>
                  Smartly's talented team of content creators, editors, and subject-matter experts, including professors from elite institutions, builds each course with smart, motivated learners in mind to ensure that the courses meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving business environment.

                </p>
                <h3>How effective is Smartly?</h3>
                <p>
                  The Smartly program has been validated through formal research. In an <a href="https://smartly.typeform.com/to/pqlQxo" target="_blank">independent academic study</a>, Smartly students performed as well or better than MBA students from HBS, Stanford, Wharton, and Fuqua in a test of accounting, and performed as well as the MBA students in a test of finance. While there are benefits to a traditional physical school including in-person interactions among professors and students and collaborative assignments between students, Smartly is proud that the quality of the instruction rivals that of the top-10 business schools worldwide.
                </p>
                <h3>Is the Smartly MBA degree licensed?</h3>
                <p>
                  The MBA program offers a licensed MBA degree. Smartly is licensed by the Washington DC Office of the State Superintendent of Education, Higher Education Licensure Commission. Accreditation, or the formal recognition by other institutions of higher learning, is a multiyear process, often taking over four years from when the first students enroll in a new program. As Smartly is relatively new, the program is not yet accredited. In the meantime, the goal is to provide an elite MBA education in a non-traditional medium and tie the benefit directly to the job market. The success of Smartly graduates in the job market is the driving force behind Smartly’s mission.
